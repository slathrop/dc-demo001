Data Collection - Demo 001
=========

Data collection application demo, originally intended for pharmaceuticals clinical trials.  Contains integrated forms builder, hipaa audit log, validation testing, and mobile computing components.  Has necessary components to become FDA and CCHIT certified.  This application represents approximately 200 hours worth of direct work, and two years of development efforts with the Meteor framework.


============================
#### Meteor Version

1.1


============================
#### Install Application

````sh
git clone https://github.com/slathrop/dc-demo001.git
cd dc-demo001
meteor
````

============================
#### Run Acceptance Tests

````sh
# optional:  you may want to reset your application data
meteor reset

# run your application as usual
meteor

# then open up a second terminal and run_nightwatch to run all tests
sudo chmod g+x run_nightwatch.sh
sudo ./run_nightwatch.sh

# or specify a specific test
sudo ./run_nightwatch.sh -t tests/homePage.js
````

============================
#### HIPAA Compliance  

To even think about bringing this into production, you'll need to add an SSL certificate to the app.
````
meteor add force-ssl
````

============================
#### FDA Certification

If you want to get FDA certified, you'll need to address the requirements in [Title 21, Part 11](http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?CFRPart=11).  Clinical-Trials currently ships with 800+ acceptance tests.  You'll probably need to increase them to close to 2000 tests to get the product ready for market, and another 2000 tests to address the regulatory requirements.  All told, if you aim for 4000 to 5000 tests, you'll probably be in the right ballpark.
